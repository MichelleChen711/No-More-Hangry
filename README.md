# Love Me Meow

##Overview

Having trouble finding the kitty of your dreams? Love Me Meow matches you with potential cats up for adoption who are looking for furrever homes and a human to love.

Instead of pages and pages of kitties to choose from (decisions, decisions...), we provide a detailed purrsonalized profile of the kitty you're matched with and choices to adopt, donate, give a heart, or share on Facebook.    

In our simple short quiz-like interface, we match your answers to the perfect cat that is looking for love from someone like you. Ensuring that the kitty you see is the kitty you'll love, Love Me Meow collects information on you and your preferred kitty: your location, time availability, home size, perferred feline personality, gender, size, age, coat length, and more.  

You can add your favorite cats to a list, view a history of all the profiles you have been matched with, donate to adoption organizations, and view success stories
